"""The GMGN skills' contract with the Web UI's "AgentOS Crypto Skills" group.

The grouping is derived, not listed anywhere: the Skills page files a shipped
skill under that heading when its manifest says ``category: crypto``, and it
paints the GMGN mark when ``provenance.origin`` says ``gmgn-mit``. Both facts
live in frontmatter, so a new GMGN skill copied from a sibling can silently land
under "AgentOS Normal Skills" wearing the generic glyph and nothing else would
notice. These tests are that notice.
